Step 1: Download Dataset 1 — Bonn EEG Dataset  

            Download the Bonn EEG dataset from the following link:  
            https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/poojapanhale/bonn-dataset  

Step 2: Download Dataset 2 — Epileptic Seizures Dataset  

            Download the Epileptic Seizures dataset from the following link:  
            https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chaditya95/epileptic-seizures-dataset  

Step 3: Download Dataset 3 — HMS Harmful Brain Activity Classification  

            Download the HMS - Harmful Brain Activity Classification dataset from the following link:  
            https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/hms-harmful-brain-activity-classification  

Step 4: Preprocess the Dataset  

            Ensure that each dataset is preprocessed before use.  
            This may include cleaning, normalization, and converting labels into a format suitable for the model.

Step 5: Open the Python Application  

            Navigate to the project folder named:  
            final_code  

Step 6: Open the Main Script  
 
            Open the file named:  
            code.py  

Step 7: Load the Preprocessed Dataset  

            When prompted:  
            - Enter the full path to the preprocessed dataset file (e.g., a CSV file)  
            - Enter the name of the label column from the dataset  

Step 8: Run the Application  

            Execute the script to train and evaluate the model using the provided dataset.

Step 9: View the Output  

            After execution, the model will display the performance results such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Specificity.

Step 10: Repeat for All Datasets  

             Repeat Steps 4 to 9 for each of the three datasets to complete the full evaluation.
